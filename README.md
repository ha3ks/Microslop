A chromium based extension that replaces occurrences of 'Microsoft' with 'Microslop' because, at this point whats the difference.

Note: This is completey inspired by the work of Steven Frank who made 'Cloud to Butt' - https://github.com/panicsteve

You can enable it for all web pages or on certain ones by Right Clicking the extension once installed:

Edge (The irony)

I am working on an Chrome extension .crx file but I'm not the most amazing programmer.

I will link the files/app stores once I have created them.

My dream is to bring this to all web browsers... as it should be!
