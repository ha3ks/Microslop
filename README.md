A web browser extension that replaces occurrences of 'Microsoft' with 'Microslop' because, at this point whats the difference.

Note: This is completey inspired by the work of Steven Frank who made 'Cloud to Butt' - https://github.com/panicsteve and my take on that being 'Musk to Belson' which replaced every instance of Elon Musk with Gavin Belson, for obvious reasons...

You can enable it for all web pages, certain ones or only when you turn it 'off and on' by Right Clicking the extension once installed:

# Installation

I have now been able to generate a fully downloadable Chromium based browser .crx file and also an .xpi file for firefox both under 'Installable Extensions'!

Alternatively and if Chrome Blocks you for installing extensions you can, nn a chromium based browser click the 3 dots > Extensions > Manage Extensions and click on Enable Developer Mode (top right) > 'Load Unpacked' (top left) > Open the downloaded File Directory (no files will be shown just hit submit).

My dream is to bring this to all web browsers... as it should be!
